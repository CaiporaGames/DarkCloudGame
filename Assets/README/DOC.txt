##### BUGS #####

-- We have a problem on the movementation when the grid start position is at (0,0,0), in the line y = 3 when we press the left/right
movement the player goes diagonaly. The right movementation is go horizontaly.
To avoid this problem for now we are starting the grid from the position (0,3,0)

-- Animation is moving the player diagonaly. 


##### IMPROVEMENTS #####

-- Create lerp function to move the player from one square to another.
-- Make a button to the player press and if the sword hit the enemy attack it will be defended.
-- Make the enemies spawn more dynamics based on the player progression. Now is just based on problabilities
-- Create a better logic to select the enemies to attack the player, maybe choose the most close or
who has the better vision of the player. Now is just randomly.
-- Create a dependency injection architecture
