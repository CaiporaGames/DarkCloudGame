##### BUGS #####

-- We have a problem on the movementation when the grid start position is at (0,0,0), in the line y = 3 when we press the left/right
movement the player goes diagonaly. The right movementation is go horizontaly.
To avoid this problem for now we are starting the grid from the position (0,3,0)

-- Animation is moving the player diagonaly. 


##### IMPROVEMENTS #####

-- Create lerp function to move the player from one square to another.
-- Make a button to the player press and if the sword hit the enemy attack it will be defended.
-- Make the enemies spawn more dynamics based on the player progression. Now is just based on problabilities
-- Create a better logic to select the enemies to attack the player, maybe choose the most close or
who has the better vision of the player. Now is just randomly.
-- Create a dependency injection architecture
-- Concentrate the save system in a single place. Now is all over the place.
-- Make a better Audio System.
-- Make the enemies death count
-- Player level count
-- Create game progression.
-- Grid custom creation.
-- Tile colors should be change by corresponding sprites. For example: green should be medicine, gray should be wall
-- Create a save button. Now is saving when we press T keyboard

##### class naming convention ######

-- The scripts that start with S are Singletons to hold some gameobjects information
-- The scripts that start with SO are Scriptable Objects to hold game data


###### My Words ######


--Personally i never create a grid game nor a turn based game, that said, the game is still very young
and i do not have time to think in a better architecture for a such type of game. 
In general was very good practice!
